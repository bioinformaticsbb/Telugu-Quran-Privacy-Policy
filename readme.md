This Privacy Policy explains how **Quran Telugu** (“app”, “we”, “our”, “us”) handles information when you use the Android application available on Google Play (package: `com.QuranTelugu.quran_telugu`).

---

## 1. Summary (What you should know)
- We **do not require accounts** and **do not sell** personal data.
- Core features run **on-device**; your **bookmarks, highlights, notes, tasbeeh counts, and preferences** are stored **locally** on your phone.
- **Location** is **optional** and used **only** for Prayer Times and Qibla Finder (if you enable it).
- Network calls use **HTTPS**. We share **no personal identifiers** with third parties.

## 2. What data we collect or process

### A) Data you store on your device (On-device only)
- **Bookmarks, highlights, notes, tasbeeh counts, reading preferences (font, theme), last-read position.**  
**Purpose:** Provide reading, personalization, and resume features.  
**Storage/Retention:** On your device only, until you delete app data or uninstall.  
**Sharing:** Not shared.

### B) Approximate/Precise Location (Optional)
- Collected **only if you grant permission** to use **Prayer Times** and/or **Qibla Finder**.  
**Purpose:** Compute local prayer times and Qibla bearing.  
**Storage/Retention:** Not stored on our servers. Coordinates are used in-app and may be sent to a prayer-time/Qibla API to compute results in real time.  
**Sharing:** Coordinates may be transmitted to the prayer/Qibla API strictly to return timings/direction; no user identifiers are attached.

### C) Device/App Info & Diagnostics (Optional)
- **Non-personal** information like Android version, app version, basic crash logs (if crash reporting/analytics is enabled in future versions).  
**Purpose:** Reliability and troubleshooting.  
**Storage/Retention:** Per the provider’s retention policy (if used).  
**Sharing:** Not sold; used only for stability analytics.

> We **do not** collect contacts, photos, media, files, messages, calendar, microphone, or camera data.

## 3. Third-party services we use
- **Quran Content & Audio:** Tarteel QUL (Quranic Universal Library) and/or equivalent open resources (text, transliteration, translations, recitations).  
- **Prayer Times & Qibla:** Aladhan (or equivalent) to calculate prayer timings and Qibla direction from coordinates you provide (when you enable these features).  
- **Networking:** Standard HTTPS libraries (e.g., OkHttp/Retrofit).

**What’s sent:** Only the **minimum necessary** request data (e.g., lat/long for timings/bearing). **No advertising IDs** or personal identifiers are sent. Each third party processes data under its own policy.

## 4. How we use information
- Render Quran in Indo-Pak Nastaliq Arabic script with English transliteration and translation.
- Provide Prayer Times, Qibla direction, optional Adhan notifications.
- Save your bookmarks/highlights/preferences **locally**.
